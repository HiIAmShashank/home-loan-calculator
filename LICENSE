that allows users to interact with it remotely, you must make the complete 
source code of your modified version publicly available as described in 
Section 6.

8. NO WARRANTY

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE 
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

10. TERMINATION

Your rights under this License will terminate automatically if you fail to

of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy 
of the Program. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying 
or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate 
your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions.

12. AUTOMATIC LICENSING

Each time you redistribute the Program or any modified version, the recipient 
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, modify, 
and distribute the Program subject to these terms and conditions.

worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license 
under any patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by 
your contribution or the Program.

14. ADDITIONAL TERMS
